Participatory Narrative Inquiry in a box. Gather stories and make sense of challenges and opportunities 
in your community or organization.

== Description ==

NarraFirma is companion software to the textbook [Working with Stories in Your Community Or Organization: 
Participatory Narrative Inquiry](http://www.workingwithstories.org).

Participatory narrative inquiry is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with 
raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex patterns for better decision making. PNI focuses on 
the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the recounting and interpretation of 
lived experience.

= What is NarraFirma? =

* It's a checklist. NarraFirma provides practical guidance as you work, with questions for you to answer, 
recommendations based on the conditions you describe, activities that help you make decisions, and just-in-time advice.

* It's a journal. NarraFirma helps you keep careful records about what happened in your project, and it 
gives you places to reflect on what happened. This reminds you to keep learning as you work, and it helps you to 
document your project for future reference.

* It's a kiosk. NarraFirma helps you collect stories, on-line and/or off-line, based on question forms you 
design (with sample questions you can copy). Because story collection is integrated, there is no need to 
export or import data.

* It's a workstation. NarraFirma helps you explore and interpret patterns in your data (stories and answers to 
questions about stories), creating annotated visualizations you can use to make sense of the stories you collected.

= Why choose NarraFirma? =

* It's portable. You can install NarraFirma anywhere, as a WordPress plugin or a Node.js web application. Web hosting 
is inexpensive, popular, and well supported. You can also install NarraFirma on your local computer and use it off-line.
(Whichever installation method you choose, we strongly suggest that you set up SSL security on your web site before collecting 
or entering confidential or important information. Many hosting providers can help you with this task.) 

* It's a team player. With NarraFirma your team can work on projects together in real time without having to hand 
files back and forth. You can plan your project, collect stories, discover patterns, and reflect on what you've 
learned - together.

* It's an open book. NarraFirma is open source software. So if you have a question about how something works, 
you can just look at the source code to find out. If you need the software to do something it can't do, you can 
add new functionality yourself or ask someone else to add it.

* It works in the real world. One NarraFirma installation supports multiple projects, forms, data sets, and reports. 
Why? Because real-life story projects are rarely simple or predictable. So go ahead and make a mess. NarraFirma 
is ready for it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I found out more about participatory narrative inquiry? =

Take a look at the book behind NarraFirma, [Working with Stories in Your Community Or Organization: 
Participatory Narrative Inquiry](http://www.workingwithstories.org)

= Does NarraFirma work for other kinds of surveys and projects? =

NarraFirma is meant to work mainly with participatory narrative inquiry. But if you want to collect 
stories for some other reason, you could still use NarraFirma for that. It's pretty flexible.

= What about web security? =

We strongly suggest that you set up any web site on which you intend to install NarraFirma 
with SSL (secure sockets). Your hosting provider should be able to help you do that.

= What should I do if I find a bug? =

Tell us about it on the WordPress support forum or the 
[GitHub issues list](https://github.com/pdfernhout/narrafirma/issues).

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the main page of NarraFirma. The sections of the software (and the phases of PNI)
are shown in the diagram and on the list to the right. Clicking on any of these buttons
leads to that section.

2. This the main page for the NarraFirma planning section. Links to all the pages in that section
are listed. You can enter reminders for any page; they show up on this page.

3. Here the NarraFirma user is describing the groups of people who will be participating in their project.
Describing your groups helps you think about how you should collect stories and what
you should do with them.

4. Here the NarraFirma user is doing a little sensmaking exercise based on some "project stories"
they told, about what might happen when they do the project. Thinking in stories
during project planning helps to make better decisions about how to carry out the project.

5. Here the NarraFirma user is deciding how they will collect stories. They are looking at recommendations
the software is giving them based on the answers they gave to the questions about their
participant groups (see screenshot 3). 

6. Here the NarraFirma user is creating questions they will ask people about their stories.

7. Here is the NarraFirma survey form participants see when they tell their stories (or NarraFirma
users see when they enter the stories they collected off-line).

8. Here the NarraFirma user is looking at stories as they come in to the collection. They are
looking here only at stories told by older people who said the person in their story
wanted to be heard.

9. Here the user is looking at patterns in the data (answers to questions) collected.
They seee thNarraFirma at older people did not often say they felt "satisfied" about their story.
They are looking at the stories to understand why.

10. Here the NarraFirma user is designing a plan for a sensemaking session,
where people will work with the collected stories and patterns to make sense of the topic
being explored.

11. Here the NarraFirma user is ansewring questions about the outcomes of the project
for each participant group. Those outcomes will determine recommendations for
interventions.

12. Here the NarraFirma user is reflecting on the entire project, to learn from it
and to keep good records for the future.
