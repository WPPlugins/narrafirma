<p>
This page is a very simple support structure for building a presentation in which you explain your project to other people (your funders, your colleagues, your community). It's not a very complete system; but it should help you to organize your thoughts about what you want to say.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Think about the points you want to make in your presentation. For each, answer the questions. You can copy story excerpts from elsewhere and paste them here. 
</p>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Can I reference graphs created during the project in this presentation?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Not in this version of NarraFirma. If you want to include graphs in your presentation, first describe them here. Then create a catalysis report and export it. Then copy the images from your catalysis report to this presentation. (It's not pretty, but it works, for now.)
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Do I even need this page?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You don't need it if you don't plan to create a project presentation. You don't need it if you would rather create your presentation in another piece of software. This page is here so that if you want to create a project presentation, you will have at least its outline in your NarraFirma project for safe keeping. (Also, we'd like to add more functionality to this part later.)
