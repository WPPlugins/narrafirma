As you finish the most prominent parts of your project, people are likely to tell you things about it. It's a good idea to note down these things so you can remember (and use) them later. This page gives you a place to remember feedback about the project.

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
For each piece of feedback you receive, make some notes on it here.

<div class="question">
Is this form only for feedback after the other parts of the project are over?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. You can use it to record feedback you get on the project at any time during its activities. If someone says something during a story collection session (like "I'm glad you're listening to people"), you can record it here. Just remember to note down when the feedback took place, so you can remember it later.
