<p>
This page where you can do narrative catalysis. Here you can look at all of the graphs 
describing your data, make observations about them, and interpret those observations.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Start by choosing a catalysis report to work with. Then look at the graphs NarraFirma has generated.
Click on a graph name in the table to see the graph below the table. You can use
the arrow buttons to move systematically through the list of graphs.
</p>
<p>
As you are looking at a graph, hover the mouse to see the stories, thus:
<ul>
<li>In a bar graph (one choice question) or histogram (scale question), hover over any 
bar segment to see the story there.</li>
<li>In a table (two choice questions considered together), hover over any 
intersection to see a list of the story names represented by the "bubble" there.</li>
<li>In a scatter plot (two scale questions), hover over any dot to see the 
story it represents.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you are looking at any graph, click and drag to look at the subset of stories
in any part of the graph. The stories in that selection will appear in the list
under the graph. 
</p>
<p>
If you think a pattern is worth noting in your report, fill in an observation
under the graph, and give the observation a name. Then enter at least two
competing interpretations &mdash; that is, two things reasonable people with different viewpoints might say about
what the observation means.
</p>
<p>
When you look back at the table at the top of the page, you will be able 
to sort it by whether you have marked the graph with an observation.
In that way you can first go through your patterns looking for interesting
patterns, then go back to the patterns you marked to think about them more
deeply.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
What do the buttons about the "graph selection" do?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you've made a selection of stories in one part of a graph (say in the upper right corner of a
scatter plot), you might want to remember those stories when you look back at your observation
again. Click "Save graph selection," and a representation of what you selected will appear in the observation
text box. 
</p>
<p>
When you return to the observation again and want to see the same stories, 
click inside that text representation, then click "Display chosen graph selection." 
The same stories should appear in the list. 
</p>
<p>
You can record and use more than one selection in your observation, and you can
(carefully) edit the representations by hand, if you want to.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What statistical tests are being reported?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<ul>
<li>
For a contingency graph (two choice questions), the statistic is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test">chi-squared test</a>.</li>
<li>For multiple histograms with mutually exclusive choices, 
the test is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Mann-Whitney U test</a> 
for differences between means. (The lowest significance level for any pair of subsets is reported.)</li>
<li>
For scatter plots, the test is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman's ranked correlation coefficient</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's test are used without testing whether
the data is normally distributed, to be conservative.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What are the extra circles on the "table" diagrams with two choice questions?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Those are the counts of stories that would be in each "cell" of the table
if the two sets of choices were distributed only by chance. You could call
them the "expected" counts, as against the counts actually observed.
Tables of count results where the expected counts are very different
from the observed counts are likely to produce significant test
results from the chi-squared test.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why do some of the table rows say "None (choices not mutually exclusive)"?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
That's because some of the tests (chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U) can only be run on mutually exclusive choices. Any questions 
where people could choose more than one answer will have no test values when they 
are combined with other questions.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What are the little colored lines on the histograms?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The red line is the mean (average) of the distribution. Each of the two green lines
marks one standard deviation away (lower and higher) from the mean.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why should I write two competing interpretations for each observation?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Here is an excerpt from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from page 272) that can explains why writing competing interpretations
is worth doing.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<p>
My placement of the generation of multiple interpretations at the center of catalysis is 
based on my observations of how people react to single interpretations of patterns. When people encounter 
one interpretation, you can see them taking sides: do I agree or don’t I? Their attention 
is on the interpretation, not on their own feelings or beliefs or experiences. They put on their armor 
and prepare to do battle. It’s clear to them that the one interpretation they see is the interpretation 
held by the author of the report: why else would they write it? And as the interpretations build 
throughout the report, people build explanations about the whole report: it’s biased, 
or the author doesn’t know what they are talking about, or the reasoning is flawed. All
of this stops sensemaking short and destroys any hope of productive thought or discussion.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, when you give people two or more <em>competing</em> interpretations of the same pattern, 
they turn their attention away from attacking or defending the interpretations and toward 
<em>exploring their own experiences</em>. This is what you want people to do. You want people to dwell 
on messy ambiguities, and to use them, until they resolve themselves naturally (or don’t). If the 
author of the report has written two interpretations, the reader <em>can’t</em> tell which is the 
author’s own, so there is nothing to attack or defend, and there are no larger explanations about 
bias or ineptitude to build. The report author essentially walks out of the picture 
and lets the reader think. The reader can put away their armor and get out their maps 
and spyglasses. They can explore.
</p>
<p>
Let me give you a more concrete example of how this works. Say I am looking at stories people 
told about their telephone service. Say I’ve seen a pattern that the younger the participant, 
the more likely they were to say they felt disappointed by the events in their story. If I give people 
one interpretation &mdash; that younger people are not happy with their telephone service &mdash; people start 
turning their binary switches off and on. Yes that’s right, no that’s wrong. But what happens if I say 
that younger people might not be happy with their telephone service, or older people might not 
understand the question, or younger people might be more willing to admit to disappointment 
(whereas older people might feel more pressure to say everything’s fine), or younger people 
might be more disappointed about other things and it drifts over, and so on? I’ve marked out a space 
for exploration and invited people on a journey, instead of setting up a straw man to be knocked down.
