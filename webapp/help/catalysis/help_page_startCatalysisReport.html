<p>
To start your catalysis process, you first need to create a report where the observations you make on the next page
(<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a>) will be stored. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Click the "Add" button to create a new catalysis report. Name the report, and add one or more story
collections to it. The data in those story collections will be shown on the 
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page, where you'll add
observations to the report.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Can I combine data from two story collections into one catalysis report?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. If you choose two or more story collections, NarraFirma will attempt to merge the
data. The stories will be in one grand list, and any questions with the same short names will be merged
as well. Be careful with this! If you have two questions with the same
short name and very different answers, the patterns you see may not be very meaningful.
