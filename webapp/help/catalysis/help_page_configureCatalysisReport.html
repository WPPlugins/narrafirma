Use this page to exclude some questions and sample sizes from your
catalysis report. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a lower threshold for story subsets. Twenty is a good default for most projects.
</p>
<p>
Choose which questions you want to include in your catalysis report.
Any questions left unchecked here will not appear in the 
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page.

<div class="question">
Why would I want to exclude questions from my catalysis report?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Sometimes questions don't turn out to be very useful, 
because people didn't understand them, or the answer possibilities you gave didn't appeal to people,
or there wasn't as much variety as you expected to find.
For whatever reason, you may not want to include every question from your story form
in your catalysis report. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why would I want to exclude stories from statistical tests? 
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you have lots of stories, you might
want to strengthen the results of your statistical tests by removing all small
story subsets from comparison. The higher this threshold the stronger, and fewer, your
statistical results will be.
Be aware that choosing a threshold below twenty will result in some test results with weaker power.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I change my mind about the question exclusions later?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Any question you uncheck here will not appear on the 
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page.
But if you include a question, write some observations about it, exclude it,
and then change your mind and include it again, the observations you wrote will
still be stored in the report. Excluding a question doesn't delete any observations
you made about it; it just makes them invisible.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What if I change my mind about the statistical threshold later?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Changing your statistical threshold might
change some test values. If you do change this value, be careful to update any
observations you've already written that depend on statistical test values.
