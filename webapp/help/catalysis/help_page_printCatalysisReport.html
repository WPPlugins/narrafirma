This page is simple: you use it to print a copy of the catalysis report you created
in the previous pages.

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a catalysis report to print, then click "Print selected catalysis report." A new
page will appear with the report on it. There is not much formatting, but
you can fix that by saving the file in HTML format, opening it in a word processor 
(many of them can read HTML), and editing it to your heart's content.

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
My word processor can't read the images in the HTML file. What can I do?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Some word processors have trouble reading the PNG files NarraFirma
generates in the catalysis report. Try a different word processor. If that
doesn't work, you can save each graph (right-click and choose Save Image As, or something
like that, depending on your browser), then import the images into your
word processor that way.
Another possibility is to print the web page to a PDF file, then 
open the PDF file in something that can save the file to other formats
(like Acrobat Pro). That seems to work.
