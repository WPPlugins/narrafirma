<div class="text">
<p>
On the
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">previous page</a>,
you made <strong>observations</strong> about patterns in your data.
For each observation, you entered multiple
<strong>interpretations</strong> about what that observation might mean
(to reasonable people who happen to disagree). 
</p>
<p>
On this page you will draw your interpretations together
into meaningful groups. Clustering your
interpretations creates a meaningful structure
to your catalysis report. People will be able to look at your report
at a high level (the perspectives), then "drill down" to the details that
lie behind each perspective.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
First choose a catalysis report to work on. Then click the "Copy interpretations to clustering diagram" button.
Move the interpretations around, placing like with like. 
</p>
<p>
When you are satisfied
that all of your interpretations are in groups that make sense,
name the groups. For each group, click "New cluster." Give the cluster
a name and description. Once you have named and described all of your
clusters (now called perspectives), you are ready to print
your catalysis report.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Do the interpretations have to be inside the cluster bubble to be counted as being
associated with that cluster?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. NarraFirma calculates the distance between the center point of each
interpretation and the center point of each cluster. As long as an interpretation
is closer to one cluster center than another, it doesn't matter if it's inside
the cluster "bubble."
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What if an interpretation is not in any cluster?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
It will still go into the report, in the section of the perspective whose center it is closest to. 
If you don't want an interpretation in the report, go back to the previous page
and delete it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What if I cluster my interpretations, then add some more observations, then come back and cluster again?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you click "Copy interpretations to clustering diagram" after you've already done it once,
NarraFirma will copy over any <em>new</em> interpretation names it finds. It will not copy
names that are already in the diagram. However, if you <em>rename</em> an interpretation,
NarraFirma will copy over the new name, leaving the old name there. You will have to 
remove it yourself.
