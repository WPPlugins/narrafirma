For each annotation question you want to add, fill in the question; choose a question type;
give it a short name; and fill in choices (which you'll need if the question is a choice question or slider).

<div class="question">
Why would I want to annotate stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
A few reasons to annotate might be as follows.
</p>
<p><b>To fix small numbers</b>. You might want to annotate stories because there are too few instances of some question answers, and you want to  
lump some answers together. You might have created too fine distinctions (for example, too-small
age ranges) or guessed wrongly at what answers people might choose (nobody picked "I love cockroaches"). 
Sometimes it's hard to compare answers (especially with statistics) when answer counts are very low.
To create a lumped question, make a new annotation with a name like "Age lumped" or "Location with fewer
categories." Then go through each story and enter a value for the new question by looking at the unlumped question. 
This is a great way to fix a question with a poorly chosen fixed list of answers.
</p>
<p>
<b>To add questions you forgot</b>.
You might want to annotate stories because you realize you forgot a question, but you can tell what the answer to it should be
based on the contents of the stories. For example, you forgot to ask people how old their
children were, but because so many people mentioned it in their stories you can add it
after the fact.
</p>
<p>
<b>To create new patterns</b>.
You might want to annotate stories because you noticed something about the stories as you read them, and you think there might be
a useful pattern, if only you could count up stories with different answers to a new question.
For example, maybe some people spoke with more emotion, or some people mentioned cats and some didn't,
or some people talked about different times in the past. You can add any new question
that you think will create patterns in your data here.
</p>
<p>
<b>To theme stories</b>.
You might want to annotate stories because you want to theme your stories. Theming is describing stories 
with summaries of their plots, like "I did my part but someone else didn't" or "It's great when
we all work together." By adding a "Themes" annotation question, you can look at themes in your graphs, 
just as though the story theme was a question you asked people.
