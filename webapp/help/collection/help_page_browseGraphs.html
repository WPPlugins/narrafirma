On this page you can look at initial patterns in the data being collected over the web (or entered by you). This page is not meant to support a comprehensive, systematic look at your patterns; that will happen in the <a href="../catalysis/help_page_catalysis.html">catalysis</a> phase of your project. This page (and the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page) are for watching your stories come in and looking to see if your story collection is going well.

Choose one or two questions to explore. You will see graphs in these combinations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Choice question: a bar graph. Hover your mouse over any of the "blocks" on the graph to see a "popup hint" with the story represented by that block.</li>
<li>Scale question: a histogram (with stories arrayed in "bins" across the scale). Hover over any block to read the story.</li>
<li>Choice question x choice question: a contingency diagram (with bubbles showing how many stories match each combination of choices). Hover over any ellipse to see the names of stories in that bubble.</li>
<li>Choice question x scale question: a series of histograms. Hover over blocks in the histograms to read stories.</li>
<li>Scale question x scale question: a scatterplot. Hover your mouse over each dot to read the story.</li>
</ul>
