<p>
On this page you can look over the stories being collected over the web (or entered by you). 
You can also correct errors in entered stories, anonymize entered stories, add annotations,
and mark stories to ignore.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
If you want to look at all of the collected stories, ignore the "Filter by" choices above the list of stories, 
and just click on a story, then click "View" (or double-click a story). Below the list of stories you will 
see the information for the story you chose.
</p>
<p>
If you want to look at specific subsets of stories, choose a question on one or both of the "Filter by" 
choice boxes, then choose which answers you want to see. For example, you might choose "Age," 
then "25-50," and you would see only stories told by people between 25 and 50. If you select 
two questions, you will see only stories that match both criteria, such as for example, people between 
25 and 50 who told stories about which they said they felt "satisfied."
</p>
<p>
You can also use this page to &mdash; very carefully &mdash; do any of these things.
</p>
<ol>
<li>You can correct mistakes in your entered stories.
If you entered your stories by hand, you may have mistyped an entry; edit your mistakes here.
</li>
<li>
You can anonymize stories, removing names and other identifying
details people entered when they used your story form. 
</li>
<li>
You can answer
annotation questions you created on the 
<a href="help_page_writeAnnotationsAboutStories.html">Write annotations about stories</a> page.
</li>
<li>
You can mark stories to be ignored. Maybe a story was a test entry, or the person said nothing but 
"I don't get it," or you made a mistake in data entry. 
To mark a story to be ignored, enter <em>any</em> text in the "Reason to ignore" field. 
That story will be left out of all graphs and reports, and will be visible only on this page.
(You can sort by the "Ignore" field to see the stories you have chosen to ignore and why.)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To change a story, select it in the table, click "Edit," and make your changes. Be careful!

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Why can't I just delete stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma does not let you delete stories completely. 
This is to avoid accidentally deleting important information.
If you need to permanently delete a story, here's how to do it.
Export your story collection to CSV, remove the offending story row in a spreadsheet program,
and import the CSV file as a new story collection.
