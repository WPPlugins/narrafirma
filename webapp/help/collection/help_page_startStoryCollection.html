A story collection identifies a specific group of stories, collected using a story form.
</p>
<p>
You can have multiple story collections within one project. For example, you might create a test collection for experimenting, a pilot collection with a draft story form, and a final story collection with a revised story form.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
When you have created, previewed, and tested your questions and story forms, and you are ready to start collecting stories, it is time to create a story collection.
</p>
<p>
Give your new story collection a name. This name won't be visible to the people who only tell stories in the project. 
It will only be visible to people who can see the pages of your NarraFirma project.
</p>
<p>
Choose a story form to use for the story collection. When you create a new story collection with a story form, 
NarraFirma will copy a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the story form as it stands at that point. 
</p>
<p>
After you've chosen a name and story form for the collection, click OK. Then select the story collection 
in the list of story collections, and click the "Activate or Deactivate Web Form" button. 
When the story form is active, you (and your participants) can add stories to the story collection 
at the web address shown (copy it and paste it into your browser).
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Can I make a minor change to the wording of a question in the story form associated with a story collection?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes you can. But heed this warning first.
</p>
<p>
NarraFirma has no way of knowing whether any change you make to your story form will 
change the meaning of the data collected using the form. 
For example, if you were to change an age question so that instead of three age 
groups you had four, NarraFirma would not be able to create graphs in which the 
two answer sets were merged. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than say you can't make changes to a story form (which would mean
you couldn't fix typographical errors), NarraFirma
gives you control and lets you update a form for an existing story collection. But make sure you don't 
break your data by doing this. Only use the updating function for changes to
wording, question order, and things like that (that don't change the meaning of the data).
</p>
<p>To make a change to a question's wording,
</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the change to the question on the page on which you created it.</li>
<li>Return to the "Start story collection page."</li>
<li>Select the story collection you want to change.</li>
<li>Click "Edit."</li>
<li>Click the "Update Story Form" button. Now your story collection will use the changed story form.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="question">
I have two story collections that are identical except for a few small differences. I'm <strong>sure</strong> it's safe to merge the data. Can I merge them?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes, but it's complicated, and you should <em>only</em> do this if there are only <em>cosmetic</em> changes to the story form between the two collections. Export both story collections, and their associated story forms, to the CSV file format. Then &mdash; carefully &mdash; merge the two CSV files with story data in them into one file, using a spreadsheet. Then import the merged CSV file into a new story collection (along with the revised story form).
