<p>
The purpose of this NarraFirma page is to think about how the main part of your project (collection, possibly catalysis, and sensemaking) turned out for each participant group.
</p>
<p>
There are two reasons to answer these questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You might want to think about how the project went so you can learn from it and plan future projects.</li>
<li>Answering questions about project outcomes feeds the recommendations you can see in the <a href="help_page_designInterventions.html">Design intervention plans</a> page.</li>
</ul>

<div class="text">

For each participant group involved in your project, create a new set of outcomes. Answer the questions about each group.
