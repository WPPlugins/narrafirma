<div class="page-title">Assess story sharing</div>
<div class="text">
<p>The better you know how people share stories (or don't) in your community or organization,
the better you will be able to plan a project that asks people to share stories. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing depends on this page, and it's entirely optional. Consider it a test of your knowledge about the people who will be telling stories in your project. If you can answer
the questions on this page, you have a good grasp of the conditions you will find when you ask people to share stories with you.
If you can't answer these questions, you might need to spend more time learning about your community or organization
before you will be ready to carry out a successful story project.

<p>
Answer the questions as well as you can based on what you know about your community or organization. </p>
<p>
At the end of the page you will see your score: a portrait of the narrative life of your community or organization.
If the score is low, it doesn't mean you can't do a story project. It just means you might need to adapt your
project to accommodate the way people share stories in your community or organization.

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
What are narrative freedom, flow, etc?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">

<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(pages 72-80) that explain the four categories of questions.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative freedom: Are people free to tell stories?
</div>
<p>A lack of narrative freedom means that people want to tell stories but can&rsquo;t. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the iron hand of authority is pressing them down; it could just mean that the culture itself is repressive or tight-lipped and prevents people from recounting their experiences freely. In any case, a lack of freedom to tell stories puts a damper on all the things story sharing can do for a community or organization.
</p>

<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative flow: Do people tell stories?
</div>
<p>This assessment category is about whether people actually do tell stories when they are given the chance. It&rsquo;s about whether story sharing is a comfortable and familiar habit, a part of daily life people participate in without even noticing.
</p>

<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative knowledge: Do people know how to tell stories?
</div>
<p>This assessment category looks at your community or organization&rsquo;s collective knowledge about the way story sharing works in groups of people: how a story starts and ends, when stories can and can&rsquo;t be told, how to reframe a story to match an audience&rsquo;s expectations, and so on.
</p>

<div class="book-quote-heading">
Narrative unity: Do people tell the same stories?
</div>
<p>The last assessment category has to do with whether stories are shared (that is, held in common) within the community or organization.
</p>
