Your answers to the PNI planning questions constitute a sort of agreement, with your team or just with yourself,
on what your project is about (and what it is <i>not</i> about). You can use these answers as a touchstone to remind yourself
what you are doing and why. You can also use them to communicate the intent behind the project with people outside it.

You can copy your draft answers (entered on the <a href="help_page_planningQuestionsDraft.html">Answer PNI planning questions</a> page) and revise them
in the light of the planning activities you did:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="help_page_participantGroups.html">Describe participant groups</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="help_page_describeYourResources.html">Describe your resources</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="help_page_projectStories.html">Tell project stories</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="help_page_createProjectStoryElements.html">Create project story elements</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="help_page_assessStorySharing.html">Assess story sharing</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These will be your final answers, so make sure you are happy with them before you move on to the next
phase of your project.
