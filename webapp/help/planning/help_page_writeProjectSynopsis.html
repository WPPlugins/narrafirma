Very much like your 
<a href="help_page_planningQuestionsDraft.html">PNI planning questions</a>, your project synopsis is an agreement 
on what your project will be about (and for). It's also a short "elevator speech" communication you can use 
to describe in a sentence or two what you are doing and why you are doing it. Write something here that will 
get people excited to participate in the project. (If you can't, do you need to do more planning?)

Summarize everything you've decided on in the planning phase of your project into a few brief sentences.
