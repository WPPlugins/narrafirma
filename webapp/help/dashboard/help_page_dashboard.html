<div class="question">
What is participatory narrative inquiry?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Participatory narrative inquiry (PNI) is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex situations for better decision making. PNI focuses on the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the
recounting and interpretation of lived experience. PNI draws on theory and practice in narrative inquiry, participatory action research, oral history, mixed-methods research, participatory theatre, narrative therapy, sensemaking, complexity theory, and decision support.

<div class="question">
Where can I read more about participatory narrative inquiry?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The NarraFirma&#0153; software is a companion to the book 
<em><a href="http://workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories in Your Community or Organization: Participatory Narrative Inquiry</a></em>
(WWS) by Cynthia F. Kurtz. WWS
describes the PNI process in full, so you can do PNI projects yourself. 
Cynthia wanted to write NarraFirma because readers of WWS kept asking her 
to help them get started doing PNI.
NarraFirma follows the book's instructions step by step,
incorporating many of its questions and suggestions. 
</p>

<div class="question">
When does NarraFirma save my data? Where is the Save button?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Any changes you make to any field in the project are normally saved immediately to the server and are relayed to other connected users of the same project.
However, if you are viewing a project in "readonly" mode, changes are only saved locally and will be lost when you reload the page or close your browser.
You can backup and restore a project (including changes made in readonly mode) using the "Import/Export" page in the Administration section.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Where do I put the stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
On the NarraFirma home page, click the <a href="../collection/help_page_collection.html">Collection</a> icon (or button). There you can collect stories over the internet or enter them by hand (from interviews or group story sessions). You'll need to create a <a href="help_page_glossary.html#storyform">story form</a> first. Story forms include questions that <a href="help_page_glossary.html#elicitingquestions">elicit</a> stories, questions about <a href="help_page_glossary.html#questionsaboutstories">stories</a>, and questions about <a href="help_page_glossary.html#elicitingquestions">people</a>. NarraFirma supports <a href="help_page_glossary.html#mixedmethodsresearch">mixed-methods research</a>, which means that you'll be looking both at the stories and at (counts of) answers to questions about them.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Does NarraFirma work only with story data?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma was designed to be used with stories. The stories can be brief anecdotes &mdash; in fact, that's usually the case. But in order for NarraFirma to work well for you, you do need to ask people to tell you <em>what happened</em> to them. If you don't have stories, you can use a variety of other software to collect and analyze data.
