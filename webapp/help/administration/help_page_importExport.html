<div class="text">
<p>
On this page you can export your data for backup, or import to restore a project.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Click any of the buttons to backup or restore your project.
<ul>
<li><b>Export entire project with history (includes survey results)</b>: As you work in NarraFirma
, the software saves every action you take using "messages" that together form a history. 
This is ground work in place for an undo system 
(which we have not yet implemented). The full project with history is much longer, but it is the most
complete version. "Includes survey results" means the backup file will include all of the 
data collected or entered: stories and answers to questions.
</li>
<li><b>Import entire project with history</b>: Copy a project JSON file into the current NarraFirma
project, overwriting anything you already have in it, to restore it (with its full history in place).
</li>
<li><b>Export current state of project (with survey results)</b>: Instead of saving your project
complete with all the messages of its history, NarraFirma can save a <em>snapshot</em> of the project
as it is right now. Saving the project this way is faster, but removes the possibility of using
any undo functionality we add later.</li>
<li><b>Export current state of project (without survey results)</b>: The same as the button above, but without
any of the collected stories and answers to questions.</li>
<li><b>Import current state of project</b>: Copy a project JSON file into the current
NarraFirma project, ovewriting anything you have in it, to restore it. Using this option
assumes that the JSON file is a snapshot and has no history in it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Can I use import and export to copy a project?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. You can export the project (with or without collected stories) to a file, then create
a new, empty project and import the data into it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Is this the only way to save the stories I collected?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. You can export your stories, and your story forms, as CSV (spreadsheet) files from the
"Enter stories" page in the "Collection" section of NarraFirma.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I use the export function to translate the entire project to another piece of software, like a word processor?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes, sort of. You can export the current state of the project (with or without survey results) and look at the 
JSON file you get. There is a lot of gobbledygook in there, but everything you entered into NarraFirma
(the way it looks right now) is also there. You can set up headings in your word processor, then
copy out the parts you want from the JSON file.
